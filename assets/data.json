            "text" : "It’s 2021 and one thing you’ve heard over and again almost every day of the week is how bitcoin is breaking its own records and setting new all-time highs. Almost every day! But you are one of those that exercise caution when it comes to what you put your money into -- and rightly so! Because scams have so pervaded the digital world today that if you’re not careful, you could lose all your money in the blink of an eye. Yet, here you are unable to shake the feeling that there just might be something different about bitcoin. And, of course, you’re right; bitcoin, as many have put it, is the digital gold and the money of the future. So, here comes the question at the back of your mind - is it too late to buy bitcoin? Let’s add some context. Bitcoin was created just over a decade ago in 2009 and it was worth next to nothing then mainly because many people had no idea what it was. Fast forward to 2020, bitcoin experienced an extraordinary kind of growth. This growth saw it leap from about US$3,850 in March 2020 to over US$29,000 at the end of the year. That means if you had invested $100 into bitcoin in March 2020, it would be worth about $750 by the end of that year. That’s over 650% increase in less than 12 months. Now, you understand the importance of the question “is it too late to buy bitcoin?”. But don’t be dismayed just yet and conclude that you’re late to the party. While it is apparent that the value of bitcoin has seen massive gains lately, it is vital to understand why the price of bitcoin is on the rise. That way, you can know what to expect, if it is indeed too late to buy bitcoin and, if it isn’t, when to buy bitcoin.",

Bitcoin and Ethereum represent half of the total market cap with $696,532,174,239 and $189,263,466,596 respectively. This increase in market cap has resulted in a surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in today's market. Crypto traders aren't surprised by this price increase, though, because an increase in the market cap of an asset divided by the total supply of that asset will result in the price increase of that asset. This year has seen bitcoin hit an all-time high of $41,973, climbing 40%. Ethereum has also made great strides in 2021 with a current all-time high of $1,760.49 which it reached on Friday, 5th of February. Both cryptocurrency assets have done really well so far this year. This has brought forward once again a frequent comparison between both cryptos to determine which assets will perform better in 2021.",

This provides easier access to financial services and gives users full control over their money. Most DeFi applications are powered by Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency platform in the world. Unlike traditional finance that require financial institutions like banks to act as middlemen, DeFi applications do not need intermediaries, the code deployed on blockchain specifies the resolution for every dispute and eliminates single points of failure.
